A simple Ruby script which scrapes Project Euler and puts each problem into a .rb file with the problem prompt as commented lines at the top.

Features:  
- Converts all images into math symbols or links to the actual image (which can then be opened directly in a text editor via plugins, e.g. Open URL in Sublime )
- Converts all superscript tags that are exponents into carets (^)

Formatting of certain problems is still off, e.g. those with long fractions and tables. Updates pending.
