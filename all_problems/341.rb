# Problem 341: Golomb's self-describing sequence
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=341

# The Golomb's self-describing sequence {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are
# 
# 
# n123456789101112131415…G(n)122334445556666…
# 
# You are given that G(10^3) = 86, G(10^6) = 6137.
# You are also given that ΣG(n^3) = 153506976 for 1 ≤n < 10^3.
# 
# Find ΣG(n^3) for 1 ≤n < 10^6.
