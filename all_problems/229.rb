# Problem 229: Four Representations using Squares
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=229

# Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because
# 
# 3600 = 48^2 +     36^2
# 3600 = 20^2 + 2×40^2
# 3600 = 30^2 + 3×30^2
# 3600 = 45^2 + 7×15^2
# 
# Similarly, we find that 88201 = 99^2 + 280^2 = 287^2 + 2×54^2 = 283^2 + 3×52^2 = 197^2 + 7×84^2.
# 
# In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.
# We are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:
# 
# n = a1^2 +   b1^2n = a2^2 + 2 b2^2n = a3^2 + 3 b3^2n = a7^2 + 7 b7^2,
# 
# where the ak and bk are positive integers.
# 
# There are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 10^7.
# 
# How many such numbers are there that do not exceed 2×10^9?
