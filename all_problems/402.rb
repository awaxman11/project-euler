# Problem 402: Integer-valued polynomials
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=402

# 
# It can be shown that the polynomial n^4 + 4n^3 + 2n^2 + 5n is a multiple of 6 for every integer n. It can also be shown that 6 is the largest integer satisfying this property.
# 
# 
# Define M(a, b, c) as the maximum m such that n^4 + an^3 + bn^2 + cn is a multiple of m for all integers n. For example, M(4, 2, 5) = 6.
# 
# 
# Also, define S(N) as the sum of M(a, b, c) for all 0 <a, b, c ≤N.
# 
# 
# We can verify that S(10) = 1972 and S(10000) = 2024258331114.
# 
# 
# Let Fk be the Fibonacci sequence:
# F0 = 0, F1 = 1 and
# Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 for k ≥ 2.
# 
# 
# Find the last 9 digits of Σ S(Fk) for 2 ≤k ≤ 1234567890123.
